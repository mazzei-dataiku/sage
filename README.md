# Sage Dashboard

* Author - Stephen Mazzei
* Email - <Stephen.Mazzei@dataiku.com>
* Version - 1.2.9

## Scope

This dashboard is designed to give Dataiku Admins insights into the DSS instance.

* DSS at a glance
* Individual objects, statistics, graphs
* Maintenance and performance reviews

## Installation

Due to the web application being built on Streamlit, installation requires a bit of dedicated code use. Hoping this changes in later DSS versions.

**TESTED ON VERSIONS:**
1. v13.5.5
